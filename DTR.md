### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
**What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)**
KN:  Work in my office, with headphones if noise elimination is needed.

**When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?**
If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.

**Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?**
We will use our laptop times and remind each other if someone notices.

**Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?**
